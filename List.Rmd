number 1, and (iii) a numeric vector (7,8,9) using the following line of code:

```{r}
a <-list ( " f " , 1 , c(7 ,8 ,9))
a
```
Return the elements 1 and 3 as a list.

```{r}
a[c(1,3)]
```
Provide each element position a name (e.g., “One”, “Two”, “Three”).
```{r}
names(a)=c("One","Two","Three")
```

Select the first and third element using their name.
```{r}
